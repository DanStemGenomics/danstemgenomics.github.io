## Welcome to the Genomics Platform


### Support on your genomics project

To start a project, discuss some ideas, ask questions, or anything else related to the platform, please contact us via [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk). We take meetings more specifically on Mondays and Thursdays. When you need a meeting, feel free to mention some time constraints you have on those days.

To book an instrument on the platform (e.g. bench, Fragment Analyser, 10X), please create an [account on PPMS](http://ppms.eu/ku/?Genomics) and then [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk) so we can add the instruments to your account.

Please join the Genomics Platform channel on the reNEW slack (if you don't have access to the slack yet, please email us)

### Service: Direct sequencing

If you are already familiar with our direct sequencing process (i.e. we have discussed it together in a meeting and given you all information so that you can use it), you can use the [Direct Sequencing Service](/directsequencing/). The submission form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSqTGVYCL0nbWNZZjvitcQ5drs0SUI86V3coCqVx7pSmD0FA/viewform).

### Help on Computing

The Genomics Platform does not provide computing resources, but can help in getting access and using existing resources:
- Danish National HPC [Computerome](/computerome/)
- KU-IT server for computational researchers [DanGPU](/dangpu/)

### Pipelines

- [CHOR-seq / SCAR-seq](/pipeline_CHOR/)
- [bulk RNA-seq](/pipeline_RNA/)

### Acknowledgments

- Remember to acknowledge the platform on your publications and other dissemination materials: “The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine, reNEW, is supported by a Novo Nordisk Foundation grant number NNF21CC0073729” (or the CPR one if you are at CPR). 
- If Computerome has been used at any point, it should appear in the acknowledgements: “Data processing and analysis were performed using the DeiC National Life Science Supercomputer at DTU (www.computerome.dk)” as mentioned on Deic website https://vidensportal.deic.dk/en/publications/acknowledgements
- Please send us your manuscript before you submit so we can follow the timelines of the various projects we are supporting (and report on our impact), as well as review the technical details
