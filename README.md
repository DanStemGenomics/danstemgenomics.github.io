## Welcome to the Genomics Platform


### Support: Starting a Genomics project

To start a project, discuss some ideas, ask questions, or anything else related to the platform, please contact us via genomics@sund.ku.dk. We take meetings more specifically on Mondays and Thursdays. When you need a meeting, feel free to mention some time constraints you have on those days.

### Service: Direct sequencing

If you are already familiar with our direct sequencing process (i.e. we have discussed it together in a meeting and given you all information so that you can use it), you can use the [Direct Sequencing Service](/directsequencing/).

### Help on Computing

The Genomics Platform does not provide computing resources, but can help in getting access and using existing resources:
- Danish National HPC [Computerome](/computerome/)
- KU-IT server for computational researchers [DanGPU](/dangpu/)

### Pipelines

- [CHOR-seq / SCAR-seq](/pipeline_CHOR/)
- [bulk RNA-seq](/pipeline_RNA/)
