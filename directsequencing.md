## Direct Sequencing Service

### What is it?
This is a sequencing service we provide for scientists who have experience with sequencing and are doing regular sequencing with the platform without needing much support from us.

* We suggest that the request is send at least 4 days in advance of the pool being ready (ideally a week) so we can plan accordingly (kit, sequencing time slot, check files) and address your request asap when the pool is in the freezer
* Each submission is independant and typically corresponds to one sequencing run
* In some cases, if you don't need the full output of a run, we can pool 2 submissions together (we talk about that on email)
* If delay in lib prep, a sequencing request can be postponed to the following week, but not more. In that case it is cancelled and resubmitted when the libraries are close to ready.

### How does it work?

1. Create your submission folder
     * Connect to the submission folder 
       * `smb://unicph.domain/groupdir/SUN-CPR-genomics-users/DIRECT-SEQUENCING-SUBMISSION/`
       * If you don't have access, please contact Magali
     * Create a folder
       * Typically Application-Name (e.g. SCAR-Valentin) 
       * With an index if submitting several runs in a short period of time (e.g. SCAR-Valentin-1, SCAR-Valentin-2)
     * Place the Fragment Analyser report and the sample annotation file
        * If not available yet, place them as soon as you have them)
        * There is a template for the sample annotation file in the template folder
2. Fill the sequencing request form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSqTGVYCL0nbWNZZjvitcQ5drs0SUI86V3coCqVx7pSmD0FA/viewform)
     * When we ask for the folder name, it is the name of the folder you just created
     * For any additional information, there is a free text field at the end
     * By default, we add PhiX. If you don't want that, please indicate in the final text box.
     * Regarding the data analysis, if you want the fastq files to process yourself, you select FASTQ, otherwise you can choose one of the existing pipelines (described here soon..). If you need more, then we need a meeting beforehand.
     * After you submit, you will receive your submission by email (on the email you have filled at the top)
3. We validate the submission (you get the submission_ID)
     * When we receive the request, we look at it and rename the folder with the submission_ID from our database
     * We schedule the sequencing with the first availability from the date you have mentioned that the samples are ready
     * We check that we have the required files at least the day before the schedule sequencing date
4. You place the submission pool in the freezer
     * Indicate on the tube the submission_ID and the concentration

During that process, if there is any question or change, please email us at genomics@sund.ku.dk mentioning the submission_ID.

If you have any suggestions to improve this process, please let us know.
